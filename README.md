# Project 2: text statistics

* Author: Jacob Reichle
* Class: APCSA Section 1
* Semester: fall 2019

## Overview

the program is supposed to take a text file as defined within the process statistics class and analyze the file, printing out the line count, word count, character count, average word length, character frequency, and word length frequency. it then prints that data to the console for the user to read and comprehend.

## Compiling and Using

To properly use this code the text file must be defined by its location on line 18 in processStatistics class. after that compiling both processStatistics and textStatistics is neccesary using javac (process), and then running the program with java will print the result to the console
## Discussion

Overall this project was very challenging and unfortunetly there are parts that i did not finish. while i was able to fully complete the line, word, and chaarcter count along with average word length, i was unfortunetly not able to complete the character frequency or word length frequency parts of this project. While i didn't get those parts to work i did make wholehearted attempts that have been commented out and defined ass uch within the text statistics class, allwoing me to potentially come back to this project at a later date and fulfill those requirements as part of a portfolio. One hard conceptual part of the project was it's ability to read each line. having to remember that it was reading text line by line instead of as a whole led to a majority of my problems, such as findng the total words when i only need the ones in the line but then add every line later. I confronted others who were working on this project for assistance however after reading certain sections i realized how unique each person's code was set up as, and that most of the time something that worked for them wouldnt exactly work for me. Overall this project got the best of me but my learning experience with it encourages me to come back to it one day possibly when i am more well fitted to solve the problems.

## Testing

for testing i made sure to compare the output with the example output provided in the project notes, compiling through netbeans 8.2 to ensure that the code ran correctly
